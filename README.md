# Rocket League Mafia Bot

A crappy bot that handles only one match at a time and not persistent

Things to upgrade:

- There can be only one match per bot (will be refactored to one match per channel, or even per host)
- Handles only 6 players in a match
- Doesn't store points when bot is restarted
